First of all, 

This is "Motion-detect" controller basis game that very similar as tower-defense computer games.

Basically the bot defenses a castle from the aliens waves.

As you keep defense your castle from the waver, the aliens' HP keep increases.

Also when each wave ends the player earns points to upgrade the weapon.

Good luck!


INFO: Full prom and demo videos are included in a folder with presentation file.
